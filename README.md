# dualSens
Dual-parameter evaluation for optical chemical sensors in the frequency domain based on mDLR.

The software dualSens is developed based on the modified Dual Lifetime Referencing (mDLR) technique used for optical chemical sensors in the frequency domain. dualSens enables the simultaneous monitoring of two parameters, either pH/O2, T/O2, CO2/O2 or pH/T. The measurement of the superimposed signal of the total phase angle is deconvoluted due to the significant time deviation between the fluorophor and the phosphor.

For more information about the theory, please have a look at the corresponding dissertation: 
Zieger, SRE 2020, Multiparametric Sensing - from Development to Application in Marine Science.


dualSens is written in Python3 and required functions are stored in PyCharm.
To run the GUI, you can either use the jupyter notebook file run_GUI.ipynb or run GUI_dualsesors_v1.py in PyCharm.
